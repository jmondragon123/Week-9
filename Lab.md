## ifconfig
1.  Primary network interface: en0
2.  IP is 10.128.194.189, while my public IP is 163.150.21.253. The difference between the two is that one is assigned for inside my current network while the Public IP is a globallly assigned IP.


## Ping

1.  IP for codepath.com is **198.58.125.217**
2.  IP for google.com is **172.217.11.78**
3.  The IP for google.com would change if you change locations because you may be accessing a different server from google.


## nslookup

1.  The domain returned from nslookup does not match because my nslookup probably does not know what domain it is.


# Milestone 1
## Challenge 1
1.  586 packets captured
    3194 packets received by filter
2.  Get request for images
3.  There is a lot less packets being captured and received because of how much less content security.codepath.com has to load.
